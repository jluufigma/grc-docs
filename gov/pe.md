### Physical Security Controls
* Access Control: Outline measures for controlling access to facilities, including physical barriers (e.g., fences, walls), entry controls (e.g., key cards, biometric systems), and visitor management.
* Surveillance: Describe the use of surveillance systems (e.g., CCTV cameras) to monitor and record activities in and around the facility.
* Security Personnel: Define the role of security personnel in monitoring and protecting physical assets and facilities.
### Environmental Controls
* Environmental Protection: Describe measures for protecting against environmental hazards such as fire, flood, and extreme temperatures.
* Temperature and Humidity Control: Outline requirements for maintaining appropriate temperature and humidity levels to protect sensitive equipment.
* Power Management: Define procedures for ensuring a stable power supply, including backup power systems (e.g., generators, uninterruptible power supplies).
### Physical Asset Protection
* Asset Management: Describe procedures for managing and securing physical assets, including inventory management and asset tracking.
* Secure Storage: Outline requirements for securely storing sensitive physical assets (e.g., servers, backup media).
### Facility Security
* Facility Design: Describe the principles of facility design that contribute to security, such as secure building layout and physical barriers.
* Emergency Exits and Safety: Outline requirements for emergency exits, safety equipment, and evacuation procedures.
### Environmental Monitoring
* Monitoring Systems: Define the use of monitoring systems to detect environmental conditions that may impact security (e.g., smoke detectors, water leak sensors).
* Alert and Response: Describe procedures for responding to environmental alerts and incidents.
